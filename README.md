# valence-arousal video estimation

Code written for my master's thesis: Procedural music generation forvideogames conditioned through video emotion recognition

This folder contains the code used to train and evaluate a 3D-CNN that predicts valence and arousal continuous values from a sequence of input frames

The dataset used for training is the discrete LIRIS-ACCEDE dataset: https://liris-accede.ec-lyon.fr/

For evaluating our method we also used the coninuous LIRIS-ACCEDE dataset and the AGAIN dataset: https://again.institutedigitalgames.com/
